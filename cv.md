### ABOUT ME

My education is related to Manufacturing engineering, as well as the machining and cutting tools design. After graduating from the University, I was enrolled in a Master's degree program in the field of Machining. After graduating from the University, I enrolled in a part-time course at the faculty of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science of the Belarusian State University. In the same year I relocated to the Russian Federation, where I have been engaging in the implementation of information technologies (BIM) in Structural Engineering. This work combines a variety of engineering and computer skills, what gives me the opportunity to use all my previous experience and knowledge. At present, I have been looking for a career opportunity in the IT sphere.
